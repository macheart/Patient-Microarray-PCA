Here I provide code for accessing and cleaning up publicly available GEO microarray dataset annotations.
Also included, is code for performing a qualiy control on your datasets. We use arrayQualityMetrics!
Finally, I include code for running your average run-of-the-mill PCA. Get fancy with other functions such as the R available function: autoplot(). 
You're welcome ~
